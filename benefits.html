                <p>Rainwater harvesting has many benefits but the main one is that it is a sustainable water management practice that can be implemented by anyone on many different levels, from a simple rain barrel to a comprehensive rainwater harvesting system that integrates with an irrigation system or household plumbing.</p><br>
                <p>When you think about itâ€¦ do we need to use municipally treated water to sprinkle on our lawns and landscaping?  Definitely not!  Harvested rainwater is the perfect candidate for irrigation use in addition to so many other water uses.  By using rainwater harvesting systems to supply water for some, or all of our water needs, you can reduce our dependence on municipally treated water.</p><br>
                <p>Overall, rainwater harvesting is viewed as a practice that is socially acceptable and environmentally responsible all the while, promoting self-sufficiency.</p><br><br>
